It appears that there's no content to work with from the GitHub repository you've referenced. To help optimize and make your site look professional, I would need the existing text, layout information, or a description of what the site currently includes.

If you could provide the content or key details about your landing page, I can assist you in improving its structure, clarity, design elements, and overall engagement factor. Please share that information for further assistance!
